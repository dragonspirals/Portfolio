# Portfolio
A project to create a portfolio page for my website

I am just getting started with Git! 

The portfolio shows a grid of portfolio items


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JS function createElement() creates an object which corresponds to each item in the grid.
Details of creating elements:

createElement(elementname) creates an object has variable name:
[elementname + "var"]

and the following properties:
title : elementname [[automatically assigned when object is created ]]
link: "examplelink.com"
img: "/images/exampleimage.jpg"
desc: "A short description of the item"
categories: [category1, category2, ...]
